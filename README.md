# Weather-App

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of server-side APIs. I was to build a weather-app from the provided code using my knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and server-side APIs. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to concepts regarding API requests and authorization. Using the Open Weather API, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Dayjs was also crucial for completing this project.
